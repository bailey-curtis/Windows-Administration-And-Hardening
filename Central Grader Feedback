Hi Bailey 
Fantastic job on your recent homework assignment! Your proficiency in PowerShell and sysadmin tasks really shines through. I must commend you on the creation of the new GPO, "No LLMNR". 
Your inclusion of a screenshot adds clarity, and overall, it's a well-executed task. Your management of GPO account lockout mechanics is exemplary. "Account Lockout" GPO is aptly configured with sensible values for lockout duration, threshold, and reset count. 
The accompanying screenshots effectively illustrate your setup. Kudos also for your PowerShell GPO creation and the activation of auditing features. 
Your attention to detail is evident in the settings for Module Logging, Script Blocking, execution policy, transcript policy, and the handling of Update-Help's default source path. Moving on to your script work, you've truly impressed. 
The for-loop implementation to enumerate ACLs of files in a folder is commendable. Moreover, completing the bonus task by providing a screenshot confirming the deployment of your "Logging GPO" showcases your thoroughness and dedication. 
Overall, this assignment has been a testament to your ability to craft robust GPOs for Windows domains. 
Keep up the excellent work and the smooth flow you've established!
